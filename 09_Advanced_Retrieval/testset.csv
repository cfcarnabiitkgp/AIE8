What are the expected developments for ChatGPT by May 2024?,"['Introduction ChatGPT launched in November 2022. By July 2025, 18 billion messages were being sent each week by 700 million users, representing around 10% of the global adult population.1 For a new technology, this speed of global diffusion has no precedent (Bick et al., 2024). This paper studies consumer usage of ChatGPT, the first mass-market chatbot and likely the largest.2 ChatGPT is based on a Large Language Model (LLM), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) developed over the last decade and generally considered to represent an acceleration in AI capabilities.3 The sudden growth in LLM abilities and adoption has intensified interest in the effects of artificial intelligence on economic growth (Acemoglu, 2024; Korinek and Suh, 2024); employment (Eloundou et al., 2025); and society (Kulveit et al., 2025). However, despite the rapid adoption of LLMs, there is limited public information on how they are used. A number of surveys have measured self-reported adoption of LLMs (Bick et al., 2024; Pew Research Center, 2025); however there are reasons to expect bias in self-reports (Ling and Imas, 2025), and none of these papers have been able to directly track the quantity or nature of chatbot conversations. Two recent papers do report statistics on chatbot conversations, classified in a variety of ways (Handa et al., 2025; Tomlinson et al., 2025). We build on this work in several respects. First, the pool of users on ChatGPT is far larger, meaning we expect our data to be a closer approximation to the average chatbot user.4 Second, we use automated classifiers to report on the types of messages that users send using new classification taxonomies relative to the existing literature. Third, we report the diffusion of chatbot use across populations and the growth of different types of usage within cohorts. Fourth, we use a secure data clean room protocol to analyze aggregated employment and education categories for a sample of our users, lending new insights about differences in the types of messages sent by different groups while protecting user privacy. Our primary sample is a random selection of messages sent to ChatGPT on consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro) between May 2024 and June 2025.5 Messages from the user to chatbot are classified automatically using a number of different taxonomies: whether the message is used for paid work, the topic of conversation, and the type of interaction (asking, doing, or expressing), and the O*NET task the user is performing. Each taxonomy is defined in a prompt passed to an LLM, allowing us to classify messages without any human seeing them. We give the text of most prompts in Appendix A along with details about how the prompts were validated in Appendix B.6 The classification pipeline is protected by a series of privacy measures, detailed below, to ensure no leakage of sensitive information during the automated analysis. In a secure data clean room, we relate taxonomies of messages to aggregated employment and education categories. Table 1 shows the growth in total message volume for work and non-work usage. Both types of 1Reuters (2025), Roth (2025) 2Bick et al. (2024) report that 28% of US adults used ChatGPT in late 2024, higher than any other chatbot. 3We use the term LLM loosely here and give more details in the following section. 4Wiggers (2025) reports estimates that in April 2025 ChatGPT was receiving more than 10 times as many visitors as either Claude or Copilot. 5Our sample includes the three consumer plans (Free, Plus, or Pro). OpenAI also offers a variety of other ChatGPT plans (Business fka. Teams, Enterprise, Education), which we do not include in our sample. 6Our classifiers take into account not just the randomly-selected user message, but also a portion of the preceding messages in that conversation. 1']","The provided context does not specify any details about ChatGPT's developments or status specifically in May 2024.

OpenAI how does it help work?,"['Table 1: ChatGPT daily message counts (millions), broken down by likely work-related or non-work-related. Total daily counts are exact measurements of message volume from all consumer plans. Daily counts of work and non-work related messages are estimated by classifying a random sample of conversations from that day. Sampling is done to exclude users who opt-out of sharing their messages for model training, users who self- report their age as under 18, logged-out users, deleted conversations, and accounts which have been deactivated or banned (details available in Section 3). Reported values are 7-day averages (to smooth weekly fluctuation) ending on the 26th of June 2024 and 26th of June 2025. messages have grown continuously, but non-work messages have grown faster and now represent more than 70% of all consumer ChatGPT messages. While most economic analysis of AI has focused on its impact on productivity in paid work, the impact on activity outside of work (home production) is on a similar scale and possibly larger. The decrease in the share of work-related messages is primarily due to changing usage within each cohort of users rather than a change in the composition of new ChatGPT users. This finding is consistent with Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025), who use choice experiments to uncover willingness-to-pay for generative AI and estimate a consumer surplus of at least $97 billion in 2024 alone in the US. We next report on a classification of messages using a taxonomy developed at OpenAI for un- derstanding product usage (“conversation classifier”). Nearly 80% of all ChatGPT usage falls into three broad categories, which we call Practical Guidance, Seeking Information, and Writing. Practical Guidance is the most common use case and includes activities like tutoring and teaching, how-to advice about a variety of topics, and creative ideation.7 Seeking Information includes searching for information about people, current events, products, and recipes, and appears to be a very close sub- stitute for web search. Writing includes the automated production of emails, documents and other communications, but also editing, critiquing, summarizing, and translating text provided by the user. Writing is the most common use case at work, accounting for 40% of work-related messages on average in June 2025. About two-thirds of all Writing messages ask ChatGPT to modify user text (editing, critiquing, translating, etc.) rather than creating new text from scratch. About 10% of all messages are requests for tutoring or teaching, suggesting that education is a key use case for ChatGPT. Two of our findings stand in contrast to other work. First, we find the share of messages related to computer coding is relatively small: only 4.2% of ChatGPT messages are related to computer programming, compared to 33% of work-related Claude conversations Handa et al. (2025).8 Second, we find the share of messages related to companionship or social-emotional issues is fairly small: only 1.9% of ChatGPT messages are on the topic of Relationships and Personal Reflection and 0.4% are related 7The difference between Practical Guidance and Seeking Information is that the former is highly customized to the user and can be adapted based on conversation and follow-up, whereas the latter is factual information that should be the same for all users. For example, users interested in running might ask ChatGPT for the Boston Marathon qualifying times by age and gender (Seeking Information), or they might ask for a customized workout plan that matches their goals and current level of fitness (Practical Guidance). 8Handa et al. (2025) report that 37% of conversations are mapped to a “computer and mathematical” occupation category, and their Figure 12 shows 30% or more of all imputed tasks are programming or IT-related. We believe the discrepancy is partly due to the difference in types of users between Claude and ChatGPT, additionally Handa et al. (2025) only includes queries that ”possibly involve an occupational task”. 2']","The context explains that OpenAI's ChatGPT is used for various purposes, including Practical Guidance, Seeking Information, and Writing. Writing is the most common use at work, accounting for 40% of work-related messages in June 2025, and includes activities like editing, critiquing, translating, and creating text. Overall, OpenAI's ChatGPT supports work by facilitating communication, providing information, and assisting with tasks such as tutoring and teaching.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
How does the usage of ChatGPT differ among users in nonprofessional occupations compared to other occupational categories?,"['Variation by Occupation Figure 23 presents variation in ChatGPT usage by user occupation. Due to privacy-preserving aggre- gation limits, we report results for the following broad occupation categories – (1) all nonprofessional occupations, including administrative, clerical, service, and blue-collar occupations; (2) computer- related occupations; (3) engineering and science occupations; (4) management and business occupa- tions; and (5) all other professional occupations, including law, education, and health care.26 As above, the left-hand side of the figure shows unadjusted comparisons and the right-hand side presents the coefficients on each occupation category from a regression of message shares on age, whether the name was typically masculine or feminine, education, occupation categories, job seniority, firm size, and industry. Users in highly paid professional and technical occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work.27 Panel A shows that the unadjusted work shares are 57% for computer-related occupations; 50% for management and business; 48% for engineering and science; 44% for other professional oc- cupations; and only 40% for all non-professional occupations. Regression adjustment moves these figures around slightly, but the gaps by occupation remain highly statistically significant. Users in highly-paid professional occupations are more likely to send work-related messages. Because work usage is so different by occupation, we restrict the sample only to work-related messages in Panels B and C. Panel B presents the share of work-related messages that are Asking messages, by occupation. We find that users in highly paid professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for Asking rather than Doing.28 This is especially true in scientific and technical occupations. 47% of the work-related messages sent by users employed in computer-related occupa- tions are Asking messages, compared to only 32% for non-professional occupations. These differences shrink somewhat with regression adjustment, but remain highly statistically significant. Panel C presents results by conversation topic. Writing is especially common for users employed in management and business occupations, accounting for 52% of all work-related messages. Writing is also relatively common in non-professional and other professional occupations like education and health care, accounting for 50% and 49% of work-related messages respectively. Technical Help consti- tutes 37% of all work-related messages for users employed in computer-related occupations, compared to 16% in engineering and science and only about 8% for all other categories. Regression adjustment affects gaps by occupation only modestly. Overall there are stark differences in the distribution of conversation topics by user occupation, with work-related messages clearly focused on the core tasks in each job (e.g. Writing for management and business, Technical Help for technical occupations). We also present data on the most common Generalized Work Activities (GWAs) associated with each broad occupation group, as measured by 2-digit Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) codes. Table 24 presents the frequency ranking of work-related messages in each SOC code of the seven most common GWAs.29 26Management and business are SOC2 codes 11 and 13. Computer-related is SOC2 code 15. Engineering and Science are SOC2 codes 17 and 19. Other Professional are SOC2 codes 21 to 29. Nonprofessional occupations are SOC codes 31 to 53. 27As discussed in Section: Data and Privacy, our dataset only includes users on ChatGPT Consumer plans. Corporate users may also use ChatGPT Business (formerly known as Teams) or ChatGPT Enterprise. 28Very few work-related messages are classified as Expressing. 29Appendix D contains a full report of GWA counts broken down by occupation, for both work-related ChatGPT 31']","Users in nonprofessional occupations, including administrative, clerical, service, and blue-collar roles, have a work-related message share of 40%, which is lower than other categories such as computer-related occupations (57%), management and business (50%), and engineering and science (48%). Regression adjustments slightly modify these figures, but the differences remain statistically significant. Additionally, users in nonprofessional occupations are less likely to use ChatGPT for Asking messages (32%) compared to those in highly paid professional occupations, especially in scientific and technical fields. The distribution of conversation topics also varies, with nonprofessional occupations focusing less on technical help and more on core tasks like writing, which accounts for 50% of work-related messages in these roles.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
What does the paper reveal about ChatGPT usage in the US?,"['Conclusion This paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025, ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop- tion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new technology is used and who is using it. This is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology. No user messages were observed by humans during any part of the work on this paper. This paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70% of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster. Second, the three most common ChatGPT conversation topics are Practical Guidance, Writing, and Seeking Information, collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages. Computer Pro- gramming and Relationships and Personal Reflection account for only 4.2% and 1.9% of messages respectively. Third, Writing is by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages overall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About two-thirds of Writing messages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text from scratch. Fourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we call Asking, Doing, or Expressing. About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance, advice, or information (Asking), 40% are requests to complete tasks that can be plugged into a process (Doing), and 1% are messages that have no clear intent (Expressing). Asking messages have grown faster than Doing messages over the last year and are rated higher quality using both a classifier that measures user satisfaction and direct user feedback. Fifth, gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have likely closed substantially over time. As of July 2025, more than half of weekly active users had typically female first names. Sixth, nearly half of all messages sent by adults were from users under the age of 26. Seventh, ChatGPT usage has grown especially fast over the last year in low- and middle-income countries. Eighth, we find that users who are highly educated and working in professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related messages and for Asking rather than Doing messages at work. Overall, our findings suggest that ChatGPT has a broad-based impact on the global economy. The fact that non-work usage is increasing faster suggests that the welfare gains from generative AI usage could be substantial. Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025) estimate that US users would have to be paid $98 to forgo using generative AI for a month, implying a surplus of at least $97 billion a year. Within work usage, we find that users currently appear to derive value from using ChatGPT as an advisor or research assistant, not just a technology that performs job tasks directly. Still, ChatGPT likely improves worker output by providing decision support, which is especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs where productivity is increasing in the quality of decision-making. 36']","The paper indicates that in the US, ChatGPT usage has grown rapidly, with over 700 million weekly users by July 2025, and more than 2.5 billion messages sent daily. It also states that about 70% of consumer queries are unrelated to work, with non-work queries increasing faster. Additionally, ChatGPT is used broadly across different demographics, with more than half of weekly active users having typically female first names, and nearly half of all messages sent by adults coming from users under 26. The findings suggest significant welfare gains from AI usage, with users valuing ChatGPT as an advisor and research assistant, especially in knowledge-intensive jobs, and its usage expanding rapidly in low- and middle-income countries.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer

While most economic analysis of AI has focused on its impact on productivity in paid work, the impact on activity outside of work (home production) is on a similar scale and possibly larger. The decrease in the share of work-related messages is primarily due to changing usage within each cohort of users rather than a change in the composition of new ChatGPT users. This finding is consistent with Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025), who use choice experiments to uncover willingness-to-pay for generative AI and estimate a consumer surplus of at least $97 billion in 2024 alone in the US. We next report on a classification of messages using a taxonomy developed at OpenAI for un- derstanding product usage (“conversation classifier”). Nearly 80% of all ChatGPT usage falls into three broad categories, which we call Practical Guidance, Seeking Information, and Writing. Practical Guidance is the most common use case and includes activities like tutoring and teaching, how-to advice about a variety of topics, and creative ideation.7 Seeking Information includes searching for information about people, current events, products, and recipes, and appears to be a very close sub- stitute for web search. Writing includes the automated production of emails, documents and other communications, but also editing, critiquing, summarizing, and translating text provided by the user. Writing is the most common use case at work, accounting for 40% of work-related messages on average in June 2025. About two-thirds of all Writing messages ask ChatGPT to modify user text (editing, critiquing, translating, etc.) rather than creating new text from scratch. About 10% of all messages are requests for tutoring or teaching, suggesting that education is a key use case for ChatGPT. Two of our findings stand in contrast to other work. First, we find the share of messages related to computer coding is relatively small: only 4.2% of ChatGPT messages are related to computer programming, compared to 33% of work-related Claude conversations Handa et al. (2025).8 Second, we find the share of messages related to companionship or social-emotional issues is fairly small: only 1.9% of ChatGPT messages are on the topic of Relationships and Personal Reflection and 0.4% are related 7The difference between Practical Guidance and Seeking Information is that the former is highly customized to the user and can be adapted based on conversation and follow-up, whereas the latter is factual information that should be the same for all users. For example, users interested in running might ask ChatGPT for the Boston Marathon qualifying times by age and gender (Seeking Information), or they might ask for a customized workout plan that matches their goals and current level of fitness (Practical Guidance). 8Handa et al. (2025) report that 37% of conversations are mapped to a “computer and mathematical” occupation category, and their Figure 12 shows 30% or more of all imputed tasks are programming or IT-related. We believe the discrepancy is partly due to the difference in types of users between Claude and ChatGPT, additionally Handa et al. (2025) only includes queries that ”possibly involve an occupational task”. 2']","The context indicates that ChatGPT has experienced rapid growth, with over 700 million weekly users by July 2025, sending more than 2.5 billion messages daily. Notably, about 70% of these messages are non-work-related, and the three main conversation categories—Practical Guidance, Writing, and Seeking Information—constitute nearly 78% of all messages. Practical Guidance includes activities like tutoring and creative ideation, while Seeking Information serves as a substitute for web search. The data also shows that users are diverse in demographics, with more than half of weekly active users having typically female first names, nearly half being under 26, and usage increasing rapidly in low- and middle-income countries. Additionally, highly educated professionals tend to use ChatGPT more for work-related tasks, especially for Asking messages that seek advice or information. This multi-faceted usage pattern, spanning both work and leisure activities across diverse demographic groups, underscores ChatGPT's broad societal impact, influencing productivity, education, and everyday life outside of traditional work contexts.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

By July 2025, 18 billion messages were being sent each week by 700 million users, representing around 10% of the global adult population.1 For a new technology, this speed of global diffusion has no precedent (Bick et al., 2024). This paper studies consumer usage of ChatGPT, the first mass-market chatbot and likely the largest.2 ChatGPT is based on a Large Language Model (LLM), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) developed over the last decade and generally considered to represent an acceleration in AI capabilities.3 The sudden growth in LLM abilities and adoption has intensified interest in the effects of artificial intelligence on economic growth (Acemoglu, 2024; Korinek and Suh, 2024); employment (Eloundou et al., 2025); and society (Kulveit et al., 2025). However, despite the rapid adoption of LLMs, there is limited public information on how they are used. A number of surveys have measured self-reported adoption of LLMs (Bick et al., 2024; Pew Research Center, 2025); however there are reasons to expect bias in self-reports (Ling and Imas, 2025), and none of these papers have been able to directly track the quantity or nature of chatbot conversations. Two recent papers do report statistics on chatbot conversations, classified in a variety of ways (Handa et al., 2025; Tomlinson et al., 2025). We build on this work in several respects. First, the pool of users on ChatGPT is far larger, meaning we expect our data to be a closer approximation to the average chatbot user.4 Second, we use automated classifiers to report on the types of messages that users send using new classification taxonomies relative to the existing literature. Third, we report the diffusion of chatbot use across populations and the growth of different types of usage within cohorts. Fourth, we use a secure data clean room protocol to analyze aggregated employment and education categories for a sample of our users, lending new insights about differences in the types of messages sent by different groups while protecting user privacy. Our primary sample is a random selection of messages sent to ChatGPT on consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro) between May 2024 and June 2025.5 Messages from the user to chatbot are classified automatically using a number of different taxonomies: whether the message is used for paid work, the topic of conversation, and the type of interaction (asking, doing, or expressing), and the O*NET task the user is performing.

By July 2025, ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop- tion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new technology is used and who is using it. This is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology. No user messages were observed by humans during any part of the work on this paper. This paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70% of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster. Second, the three most common ChatGPT conversation topics are Practical Guidance, Writing, and Seeking Information, collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages. Computer Pro- gramming and Relationships and Personal Reflection account for only 4.2% and 1.9% of messages respectively. Third, Writing is by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages overall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About two-thirds of Writing messages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text from scratch. Fourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we call Asking, Doing, or Expressing. About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance, advice, or information (Asking), 40% are requests to complete tasks that can be plugged into a process (Doing), and 1% are messages that have no clear intent (Expressing). Asking messages have grown faster than Doing messages over the last year and are rated higher quality using both a classifier that measures user satisfaction and direct user feedback. Fifth, gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have likely closed substantially over time. As of July 2025, more than half of weekly active users had typically female first names. Sixth, nearly half of all messages sent by adults were from users under the age of 26. Seventh, ChatGPT usage has grown especially fast over the last year in low- and middle-income countries. Eighth, we find that users who are highly educated and working in professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related messages and for Asking rather than Doing messages at work. Overall, our findings suggest that ChatGPT has a broad-based impact on the global economy. The fact that non-work usage is increasing faster suggests that the welfare gains from generative AI usage could be substantial. Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025) estimate that US users would have to be paid $98 to forgo using generative AI for a month, implying a surplus of at least $97 billion a year. Within work usage, we find that users currently appear to derive value from using ChatGPT as an advisor or research assistant, not just a technology that performs job tasks directly. Still, ChatGPT likely improves worker output by providing decision support, which is especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs where productivity is increasing in the quality of decision-making. 36']","The context highlights that the US is significant because, as of July 2025, it accounts for a substantial portion of ChatGPT usage, with over 700 million weekly users and more than 2.5 billion messages sent daily. Additionally, the analysis shows that non-work messages in the US are increasing faster than work-related ones, indicating a societal shift towards more casual and diverse interactions with AI tools. This growth in non-work messages, which now represent over 70% of all consumer ChatGPT messages, underscores the expanding role of AI in everyday life and social interactions within the US, reflecting its importance in societal impacts and emerging interaction patterns.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How does the growth of ChatGPT usage in the US relate to its impact on work and non-work activities?,"['<1-hop>\n\nTable 1: ChatGPT daily message counts (millions), broken down by likely work-related or non-work-related. Total daily counts are exact measurements of message volume from all consumer plans. Daily counts of work and non-work related messages are estimated by classifying a random sample of conversations from that day. Sampling is done to exclude users who opt-out of sharing their messages for model training, users who self- report their age as under 18, logged-out users, deleted conversations, and accounts which have been deactivated or banned (details available in Section 3). Reported values are 7-day averages (to smooth weekly fluctuation) ending on the 26th of June 2024 and 26th of June 2025. messages have grown continuously, but non-work messages have grown faster and now represent more than 70% of all consumer ChatGPT messages. While most economic analysis of AI has focused on its impact on productivity in paid work, the impact on activity outside of work (home production) is on a similar scale and possibly larger. The decrease in the share of work-related messages is primarily due to changing usage within each cohort of users rather than a change in the composition of new ChatGPT users. This finding is consistent with Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025), who use choice experiments to uncover willingness-to-pay for generative AI and estimate a consumer surplus of at least $97 billion in 2024 alone in the US. We next report on a classification of messages using a taxonomy developed at OpenAI for un- derstanding product usage (“conversation classifier”). Nearly 80% of all ChatGPT usage falls into three broad categories, which we call Practical Guidance, Seeking Information, and Writing. Practical Guidance is the most common use case and includes activities like tutoring and teaching, how-to advice about a variety of topics, and creative ideation.7 Seeking Information includes searching for information about people, current events, products, and recipes, and appears to be a very close sub- stitute for web search. Writing includes the automated production of emails, documents and other communications, but also editing, critiquing, summarizing, and translating text provided by the user. Writing is the most common use case at work, accounting for 40% of work-related messages on average in June 2025. About two-thirds of all Writing messages ask ChatGPT to modify user text (editing, critiquing, translating, etc.) rather than creating new text from scratch. About 10% of all messages are requests for tutoring or teaching, suggesting that education is a key use case for ChatGPT. Two of our findings stand in contrast to other work. First, we find the share of messages related to computer coding is relatively small: only 4.2% of ChatGPT messages are related to computer programming, compared to 33% of work-related Claude conversations Handa et al. (2025).8 Second, we find the share of messages related to companionship or social-emotional issues is fairly small: only 1.9% of ChatGPT messages are on the topic of Relationships and Personal Reflection and 0.4% are related 7The difference between Practical Guidance and Seeking Information is that the former is highly customized to the user and can be adapted based on conversation and follow-up, whereas the latter is factual information that should be the same for all users. For example, users interested in running might ask ChatGPT for the Boston Marathon qualifying times by age and gender (Seeking Information), or they might ask for a customized workout plan that matches their goals and current level of fitness (Practical Guidance). 8Handa et al. (2025) report that 37% of conversations are mapped to a “computer and mathematical” occupation category, and their Figure 12 shows 30% or more of all imputed tasks are programming or IT-related. We believe the discrepancy is partly due to the difference in types of users between Claude and ChatGPT, additionally Handa et al. (2025) only includes queries that ”possibly involve an occupational task”. 2', '<2-hop>\n\nConclusion This paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025, ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop- tion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new technology is used and who is using it. This is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology. No user messages were observed by humans during any part of the work on this paper. This paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70% of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster. Second, the three most common ChatGPT conversation topics are Practical Guidance, Writing, and Seeking Information, collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages. Computer Pro- gramming and Relationships and Personal Reflection account for only 4.2% and 1.9% of messages respectively. Third, Writing is by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages overall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About two-thirds of Writing messages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text from scratch. Fourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we call Asking, Doing, or Expressing. About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance, advice, or information (Asking), 40% are requests to complete tasks that can be plugged into a process (Doing), and 1% are messages that have no clear intent (Expressing). Asking messages have grown faster than Doing messages over the last year and are rated higher quality using both a classifier that measures user satisfaction and direct user feedback. Fifth, gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have likely closed substantially over time. As of July 2025, more than half of weekly active users had typically female first names. Sixth, nearly half of all messages sent by adults were from users under the age of 26. Seventh, ChatGPT usage has grown especially fast over the last year in low- and middle-income countries.

This suggests that ChatGPT is significantly impacting both work and non-work activities, with a substantial portion of its usage dedicated to practical guidance, writing, and seeking information—factual information that often substitutes for web search. The growth in non-work usage reflects potential welfare gains and broader economic impacts, as users leverage ChatGPT for personal and educational purposes alongside professional tasks.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
wha november 2022 did ChatGPT lauched and how many messages were sent by july 2025?,"['<1-hop>\n\nIntroduction ChatGPT launched in November 2022. By July 2025, 18 billion messages were being sent each week by 700 million users, representing around 10% of the global adult population.1 For a new technology, this speed of global diffusion has no precedent (Bick et al., 2024). This paper studies consumer usage of ChatGPT, the first mass-market chatbot and likely the largest.2 ChatGPT is based on a Large Language Model (LLM), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) developed over the last decade and generally considered to represent an acceleration in AI capabilities.3 The sudden growth in LLM abilities and adoption has intensified interest in the effects of artificial intelligence on economic growth (Acemoglu, 2024; Korinek and Suh, 2024); employment (Eloundou et al., 2025); and society (Kulveit et al., 2025). However, despite the rapid adoption of LLMs, there is limited public information on how they are used. A number of surveys have measured self-reported adoption of LLMs (Bick et al., 2024; Pew Research Center, 2025); however there are reasons to expect bias in self-reports (Ling and Imas, 2025), and none of these papers have been able to directly track the quantity or nature of chatbot conversations. Two recent papers do report statistics on chatbot conversations, classified in a variety of ways (Handa et al., 2025; Tomlinson et al., 2025). We build on this work in several respects. First, the pool of users on ChatGPT is far larger, meaning we expect our data to be a closer approximation to the average chatbot user.4 Second, we use automated classifiers to report on the types of messages that users send using new classification taxonomies relative to the existing literature. Third, we report the diffusion of chatbot use across populations and the growth of different types of usage within cohorts. Fourth, we use a secure data clean room protocol to analyze aggregated employment and education categories for a sample of our users, lending new insights about differences in the types of messages sent by different groups while protecting user privacy. Our primary sample is a random selection of messages sent to ChatGPT on consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro) between May 2024 and June 2025.5 Messages from the user to chatbot are classified automatically using a number of different taxonomies: whether the message is used for paid work, the topic of conversation, and the type of interaction (asking, doing, or expressing), and the O*NET task the user is performing. Each taxonomy is defined in a prompt passed to an LLM, allowing us to classify messages without any human seeing them. We give the text of most prompts in Appendix A along with details about how the prompts were validated in Appendix B.6 The classification pipeline is protected by a series of privacy measures, detailed below, to ensure no leakage of sensitive information during the automated analysis. In a secure data clean room, we relate taxonomies of messages to aggregated employment and education categories. Table 1 shows the growth in total message volume for work and non-work usage. Both types of 1Reuters (2025), Roth (2025) 2Bick et al.

OpenAI also offers a variety of other ChatGPT plans (Business fka.
