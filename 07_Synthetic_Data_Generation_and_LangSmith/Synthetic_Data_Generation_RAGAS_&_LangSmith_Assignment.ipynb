Specifically, they work by analyzing the knowledge graph to find relevant nodes and relationships, create personas (fictional users that interact with your data), generate scenarios that combine personas with specific data contexts and finally produce realistic questions that these personas would ask. Next, we describe each query synthesizer:\n",

        "1. *SingleHopSpecificQuerySynthesizer* -  creates simple, direct questions that can be answered from a single piece of information. It finds nodes with named entities, creates personas who would be interested in those entitiies and generates starightforward questions. e.g. \"Which AI companies are mentioned in this document?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "2. *MultiHopAbstractQuerySynthesizer* - creates complex questions requiring reasoning across multiple related concepts and themes. It works by clustering nodes based on summary similarity, extracts abstract themes from multiple documents, generates personas interested in broader patterns and finally combining them to create conceptual questions. e.g. \"How do the themes of AI adoption in healthcare relate to patient outcome improvements across different demographic groups?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "3. *MultiHopSpecificQuerySynthesizer* - creates questions that require connecting specific facts across multiple documents through shared entities. It works by finding pairs of nodes that shares common entities, identifies overlapping info between documents, creates personas interested in specific factual connections, and generates questions requiring factual reasoning. e.g. \"What specific healthcare applications has Dr. Smith developed using machine learning?\"\n",

The variation in usage by occupation indicates that work-related messages are focused on core job tasks, with scientific and technical occupations showing a higher tendency to use ChatGPT for asking questions, while management and business occupations focus more on writing.

            " Reference contexts: ['<1-hop>\\n\\nVariation by Occupation Figure 23 presents variation in ChatGPT usage by user occupation. Due to privacy-preserving aggre- gation limits, we report results for the following broad occupation categories – (1) all nonprofessional occupations, including administrative, clerical, service, and blue-collar occupations; (2) computer- related occupations; (3) engineering and science occupations; (4) management and business occupa- tions; and (5) all other professional occupations, including law, education, and health care.26 As above, the left-hand side of the figure shows unadjusted comparisons and the right-hand side presents the coefficients on each occupation category from a regression of message shares on age, whether the name was typically masculine or feminine, education, occupation categories, job seniority, firm size, and industry. Users in highly paid professional and technical occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work.27 Panel A shows that the unadjusted work shares are 57% for computer-related occupations; 50% for management and business; 48% for engineering and science; 44% for other professional oc- cupations; and only 40% for all non-professional occupations. Regression adjustment moves these figures around slightly, but the gaps by occupation remain highly statistically significant. Users in highly-paid professional occupations are more likely to send work-related messages. Because work usage is so different by occupation, we restrict the sample only to work-related messages in Panels B and C. Panel B presents the share of work-related messages that are Asking messages, by occupation. We find that users in highly paid professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for Asking rather than Doing.28 This is especially true in scientific and technical occupations. 47% of the work-related messages sent by users employed in computer-related occupa- tions are Asking messages, compared to only 32% for non-professional occupations. These differences shrink somewhat with regression adjustment, but remain highly statistically significant. Panel C presents results by conversation topic. Writing is especially common for users employed in management and business occupations, accounting for 52% of all work-related messages. Writing is also relatively common in non-professional and other professional occupations like education and health care, accounting for 50% and 49% of work-related messages respectively. Technical Help consti- tutes 37% of all work-related messages for users employed in computer-related occupations, compared to 16% in engineering and science and only about 8% for all other categories. Regression adjustment affects gaps by occupation only modestly. Overall there are stark differences in the distribution of conversation topics by user occupation, with work-related messages clearly focused on the core tasks in each job (e.g. Writing for management and business, Technical Help for technical occupations). We also present data on the most common Generalized Work Activities (GWAs) associated with each broad occupation group, as measured by 2-digit Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) codes. Table 24 presents the frequency ranking of work-related messages in each SOC code of the seven most common GWAs.29 26Management and business are SOC2 codes 11 and 13. Computer-related is SOC2 code 15. Engineering and Science are SOC2 codes 17 and 19. Other Professional are SOC2 codes 21 to 29. Nonprofessional occupations are SOC codes 31 to 53. 27As discussed in Section: Data and Privacy, our dataset only includes users on ChatGPT Consumer plans. Corporate users may also use ChatGPT Business (formerly known as Teams) or ChatGPT Enterprise. 28Very few work-related messages are classified as Expressing. 29Appendix D contains a full report of GWA counts broken down by occupation, for both work-related ChatGPT 31']\n"

Especially in brain-heavy, knowledge-packed jobs, AI is flipping productivity switches by leveling up how choices get made. So it’s not just about automation, it’s about turbocharging human smarts to make sharper, faster calls that pay off.\\n\\nCollis and Brynjolfsson (2025) drop a mind-melting stat: in the US, users would pay nearly a hundred bucks *per month* just to keep this AI magic—meaning the surplus value added is a jaw-dropping $97 billion a year. That’s straight-up economic fire — workers getting paid by AI-powered decisions and insights, not just sweat and grind.\\n\\nIn sum: humans are cashing in by leaning on AI as a strategic partner to supercharge their hustle, turning complex decisions into cold hard cash with AI’s razor-sharp guidance. This isn’t just AI doing your job — it’s AI *making you better* at your job and stacking digits. Rad, right?'"

        "✅ **Answer**: From the above screenshot, we see all the 3 metrics improved for the second experiment compared to the first one. In my opinion, the dopeness metric improved dramatically because of the direct prompt enhancement made in `DOPENESS_RAG_PROMPT` that explicitly asks for \"rad\" answers with \"high levels of dopeness\" and not to give \"generic answers\" - things that improves the criteria mentioned in the `dopeness_evaluator`. The other 2 metrics (qa and labeled helpfulness) improved primaeily due to the underlying improvements in chunk size and embeddings that made responses more accurate and helpful overall. Its important to note that the absolute values of these metrics dont matter, rather the relative changes is indicative of whether changes to our RAG app improve quality of queries generated (in line with metrics drive development )."
