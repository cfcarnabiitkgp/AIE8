    "The process of embedding is typically very time consuming and expensive:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Send text to OpenAI API endpoint\n",
    "2. Wait for processing  \n",

    "This occurs *every single time* a document gets converted into a vector representation.\n",

    "**Our Caching Solution:**\n",
    "1. Check local cache for previously computed embeddings\n",
    "2. If found: Return cached vector (instant, free)\n",
    "3. If not found: Call OpenAI API, store result in cache\n",

    "##### ✅ Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory v/s Disk Caching limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memory cache is volatile and is lost everytime on restart/crash - so all LLM responses must be regenrated\n",

    "- There is no upper bound set on size of `InMemoryCache`\n",
    "\n",
    "Cache Invalidation limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If rag document data is updated (e.g., pdf file is updated) we are still left with old, stale embeddings in cache folder\n",
    "- No versioning to track which cache corresponds to which document version\n",
    "- Manual cleanup is needed to delete cache directory to invalidate\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrent Access Patterns limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `InMemoryCache` is duplicated per instance (e.g. every instance of the Jupyter notebook) so there is massive duplication\n",
    "- Can't sync caches across servers in production\n",
    "\n",
    "Cache Size Management limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cache can grow unbounded and there is no eviction strategy to remove unused or stale cache data\n",
    "- Possibility of filling up memory completely with `InMemoryCache` (out of memory error)\n",
    "- No monitoring to keep track of cache hit rates, size or health\n",
    "\n",
    "Cold start scenarios limitations:\n",
    "- Poor initial experience as first query is always slow (no prewarming)\n",
    "- Server restarts reset LLM caches\n",
    "- No semantic understanding in cache retrieval (using exact matching) so cant anticipate common queries\n"

    "##### ✅ Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "**When would you choose each agent type?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use simple agent when we are concerned with lower latency and costs (no self reflection or quality checking), desire predictable performances, deal with well-defiend straightforward queries, want something easier to debug, and and where perfect accuracy of internal tools used is not production-critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Helpfulness agent on the other hand is desirable when we desire higher quality responses (self-reflect + refinement), reduce hallucinations and desire adaptive behavior (retrying with different tools until desirable answer is reached) but it comes at the expense of latency, costs, and complex debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Helpfulness check increases latency due to the self-refinement loop\n",
    "- Costs increase wit hthe self-refinement loop\n",
    "- It would be nice to have a layer that categorizes queries as straightforward/simple that can be routed to the simple agent v/s ambiguous or more complex questions that are routed to the helpfulness agent, i.e., implement adaptive routing based on query complexity and system load\n",
    "- Monitor agent performance based on quality metrics (recall, precision, faithfulness etc. calculated on data stored from the LLM interactions) while also keeping tarck of the p50, p95 latency and total token cost considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalability Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Helpfulness agent will struggle before simple agent when concurrent calls increase as it makes 2x more API calls and can hot API rate limits sooner - it is better to use the helfulness agent during periods of low load\n",
    "\n",
    "- For simple agent (apart from emebedding cache), the following caching may help:\n",
    "    - LLM response cache\n",
    "    - Tool output cache (caching retrieval and web search)\n",
    "    - Redis for distributed caching across instances\n",
    "\n",
    "- For helpfulness agent, the following caching may help:\n",
    "    - Conditional LLM caching to only cache responses that pass helpfulness check (e.g. scores > 0.8)\n",
    "    - Cachin helpfulness evaluations separately (to avoid re-evaluating same response)\n",
    "    - Match similar queries and use semantic caching which is especially useful for complex queries\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can use the following strategies for rate-limiting and circuit-breaker patterns:\n",
    "    - Rate Limiting:\n",
    "        - Per-user limits\n",
    "        - Global limits (respecting OpenAI tier limits)\n",
    "        - Sliding window counter to track requests and token usage over time window\n",
    "        - More expensive agents get lower limits\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Circuit breaking:\n",

    "Based on our comprehensive testing with cache clearing between agent comparisons, here are the key findings:\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎯 1. Agent Performance Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "| Query Type | Simple Agent | Helpfulness Agent | Overhead |\n",
    "|-----------|--------------|-------------------|----------|\n",
    "| **RAG-focused** | 2.62s | 3.35s | **+28.0%** ✅ |\n",
    "| **Web search** | 8.13s | 8.85s | **+8.8%** ✅ |\n",
    "| **Academic** | 3.94s | 3.76s | **-4.6%** ⚠️ |\n",
    "| **Multi-tool** | 10.86s | 12.66s | **+16.6%** ✅ |\n",
    "| **Average** | **6.39s** | **7.16s** | **+12.0%** |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observation**: With cache clearing implemented, the helpfulness agent shows **consistent +12% average overhead** as expected. The academic query showing negative overhead (-4.6%) is within normal API variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔧 2. Tool Selection Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Both agents demonstrated **identical and appropriate tool selection**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RAG-focused queries** → `retrieve_information` only\n",
    "- **Web search queries** → `tavily_search_results_json` only  \n",
    "- **Academic queries** → `arxiv` only\n",
    "- **Multi-tool queries** → Both `retrieve_information` + `tavily_search_results_json`\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Conclusion**: Tool routing logic is deterministic and works correctly for both agent types.\n",

    "| Time Saved | - | 2.04s | **42% reduction** |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query Variations**:\n",
    "- Similar phrasing (\"What repayment options exist...\") → **3.00s (HIT)** ✅\n",
    "- Different phrasing (\"Tell me about Direct Loan...\") → **4.22s (MISS)** ⚠️\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insight**: InMemoryCache uses **exact matching**, not semantic similarity. Query rephrasing causes cache misses.\n",

    "| Test Case | Status | Response Time | Behavior |\n",
    "|-----------|--------|---------------|----------|\n",
    "| Empty query | ✅ Pass | 0.52s | Friendly greeting response |\n",
    "| Very long query (50x repetition) | ✅ Pass | 10.08s | Handles gracefully |\n",
    "| Special characters (emojis) | ✅ Pass | 2.91s | Processes correctly |\n",
    "| SQL injection attempt | ✅ Pass | 1.58s | Recognizes attack pattern |\n",
    "| Cross-domain query (crypto + loans) | ✅ Pass | 6.57s | Handles both domains |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: Agents demonstrate **robust error handling** across all edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 💡 5. Key Production Insights\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Now we'll integrate **Guardrails AI** into our production system to ensure our agents operate safely and within acceptable boundaries. Guardrails provide essential safety layers for production LLM applications by validating inputs, outputs, and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛡️ What are Guardrails?\n",
    "\n",
    "Guardrails are specialized validation systems that help \"catch\" when LLM interactions go outside desired parameters. They operate both **pre-generation** (input validation) and **post-generation** (output validation) to ensure safe, compliant, and on-topic responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Categories:**\n",
    "- **Topic Restriction**: Ensure conversations stay on-topic\n",
    "- **PII Protection**: Detect and redact sensitive information  \n",
    "- **Content Moderation**: Filter inappropriate language/content\n",
    "- **Factuality Checks**: Validate responses against source material\n",
    "- **Jailbreak Detection**: Prevent adversarial prompt attacks\n",
    "- **Competitor Monitoring**: Avoid mentioning competitors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Benefits of Guardrails\n",
    "\n",
    "**🏢 Enterprise Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for data protection\n",
    "- **Brand Safety**: Maintain consistent, appropriate communication tone\n",
    "- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduce liability from inappropriate AI responses\n",
    "- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure factual accuracy and relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚡ Technical Advantages:**\n",
    "- **Layered Defense**: Multiple validation stages for robust protection\n",
    "- **Selective Enforcement**: Different guards for different use cases\n",
    "- **Performance Optimization**: Fast validation without sacrificing accuracy\n",
    "- **Integration Ready**: Works seamlessly with LangGraph agent workflows\n"

    "\n",
    "**📋 Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Guardrails Node**: \n",
    "   - Implement input validation (jailbreak, topic, PII detection)\n",
    "   - Implement output validation (content moderation, factuality)\n",
    "   - Handle guard failures gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integrate with Agent Workflow**:\n",
    "   - Add guards as a pre-processing step\n",
    "   - Add guards as a post-processing step  \n",
    "   - Implement refinement loops for failed validations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test with Adversarial Scenarios**:\n",
    "   - Test jailbreak attempts\n",
    "   - Test off-topic queries\n",
    "   - Test inappropriate content generation\n",
    "   - Test PII leakage scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 Success Criteria:**\n",
    "- Agent blocks malicious inputs while allowing legitimate queries\n",
    "- Agent produces safe, factual, on-topic responses\n",
    "- System gracefully handles edge cases and provides helpful error messages\n",
    "- Performance remains acceptable with guard overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Implementation Hints:**\n",
    "- Use LangGraph's conditional routing for guard decisions\n",
    "- Implement both synchronous and asynchronous guard validation\n",
    "- Add comprehensive logging for security monitoring\n",
    "- Consider guard performance vs security trade-offs\n"
