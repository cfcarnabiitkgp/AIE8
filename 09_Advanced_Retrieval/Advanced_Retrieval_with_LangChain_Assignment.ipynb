Multi query retrieval (essentually generating multiple variants of an user query) improves recall in the following ways:\n",

        "- Users often address same information in different ways (e.g. different personas, tones, phrasing, synonyms etc.) so multi-variants can address query ambiguity\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Each un-split \"document\" will be designated as a \"parent document\" (You could use larger chunks of document as well, but our data format allows us to consider the overall document as the parent chunk)\n",
        "2. Store those \"parent documents\" in a memory store (not a VectorStore)\n",
        "3. We will chunk each of those documents into smaller documents, and associate them with their respective parents, and store those in a VectorStore. We'll call those \"child chunks\".\n",
        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
        "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",
        "\n",

        "- Return big documents\n",
        "\n",
